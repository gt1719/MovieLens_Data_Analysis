# MovieLens Data Anaysis


Author: Gamze Turan


## Overview

Movielens is a website that helps users find movies they will like. It users ratings given by the user to build a custom taste profile of that particular user and then utilizes that information to recommend other movies for the user to watch.

## Business Understanding

In this analysis, I will try to build a variety of engines and improve upon predictions iteratively so that the end user can be provided with better movie suggestions.

## Data Understanding

The datasets describe ratings and free-text tagging activities from [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/), a movie recommendation service.

It contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users.

The dataset is distributed among four csv files: `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`.
